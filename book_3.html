            <p>As companies around the globe shift their stack to the cloud, the demand for IT professionals with cloud computing skills has never been higher. In the past, IT roles were largely specialized: Linux admin, storage admin, network admin. Today, however, the shift to the cloud requires proficiency in all of these skills. Learn AWS, Azure, SpringBoot, and OpenStack with Udemy courses today and take your knowledge of cloud computing to the next level.</p>
            <p>Cloud computing has become the modern model for IT infrastructure, and there are many public cloud services to choose from. One popular cloud provider is Amazon Web Services or AWS. Amazon Web Services was the early leader in cloud computing services and currently a major provider of machine learning, database, and serverless cloud services. Microsoft Azure is another major cloud service. They provide their well-known Office suite of software including Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint using a software as a service (SaaS) model to their enterprise customers, as well as other general cloud computing services. The third-largest cloud provider is Google Cloud Platform. It works well for customers who want to integrate with Google's other offerings, like Google ads. Other cloud services available include Alibaba Cloud, IBM Cloud, and Oracle Cloud.</p>
